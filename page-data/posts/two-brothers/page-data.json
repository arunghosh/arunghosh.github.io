To make situation worse, the fate played itâ€™s part, like in a movie. His situation got worse.</p>\n<p>Now the rich bother can see the miserable plight of the other, but he cared not to help. And instead he gave his mother the riches and the care. But will the mother be happy with the offerings made by her successful son when the other son is suffering? </p>\n<p>Now lets come back from the story to the reality.

If so, can you make the Father, the God, happy with some rich offering, praises and thanks giving when the majority of the population is suffering? What does He expect us to do or what can we do to make Him happy; offer Him riches and praises or help His other creations?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/two-brothers","tagSlugs":["/tag/docker/","/tag/philosophy/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-08-10T22:40:32.169Z","description":"A small story of two brothers.","tags":["Docker","Philosophy"],"title":"Two brothers","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/two-brothers"}}}
