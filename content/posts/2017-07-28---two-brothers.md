description: "A small story of two brothers."
---

A mother had two sons. One was brilliant and grew up to become a financially successful individual. Other was not brilliant. He became someone who was struggling to make both ends meet. To make situation worse, the fate played it's part, like in a movie. His situation got worse.

Now the rich bother can see the miserable plight of the other, but he cared not to help. And instead he gave his mother the riches and the care. But will the mother be happy with the offerings made by her successful son when the other son is suffering? 

Now lets come back from the story to the reality. Most of the major religion say(claim) that we are all creation of God and majority of us follow of one of these religions. So in that sense, from the point of God, we are brothers and sisters. If so, can you make the Father, the God, happy with some rich offering, praises and thanks giving when the majority of the population is suffering? What does He expect us to do or what can we do to make Him happy; offer Him riches and praises or help His other creations?
