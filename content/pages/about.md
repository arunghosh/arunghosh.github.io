I am Arun Ghosh, a being from God's own country, Kerala. Kerala is a small state in India. 

I started my career as embedded system developer in automobile industry for 
Bosch. I worked mostly with embedded C, C++ and automobile 
communication protocols like CAN and LIN. 

Later I moved to Siemens where I developed web and desktop application using .Net technologies (C#/ASP MVC, WPF, Silverlight) in medical domain.

After that, I was mainly into JavaScript (ReactJS/NodeJS), Python (Django/NLP) and AWS for the past 8 years.
And during this time I am fortunate enough to [open source some works I did](https://github.com/arunghosh).

You can reach me ```arunghosh[at]gmail.com```
